    Delicious poached eggs.
</p>
<p>
    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>Any number of fresh eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of white or rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teasppon fine salt</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Steps
    <ol>
        <li>Line a small baking sheet or plate with paper towels or a clean dish towel.</li>
        <li>Fill a wide saucepan at least 4 inches deep with water and bring to a boil over high heat..</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to low and bring the water to a very gentle simmer. Bubbles should form at the bottom of the pan, but only a few will actually break on the surface.</li>
        <li>Add the vinegar and salt to the water (optional).</li>
        <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl and carefully slide it into the water. Set a timer for 3 to 4 minutes (3 minutes for completely runny yolks). After 20 seconds, use a spoon to carefully push the egg white up over the yolk, making it more compact.</li>
        <li>Transfer the poached egg with a slotted spoon to the lined baking sheet or plate and leave for 15 to 20 seconds before serving.</li>
    </ol>
